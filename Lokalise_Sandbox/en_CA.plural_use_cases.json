However, it will be counted as \"translated\" on Lokalise. This placeholder can come in handy when you do not have a proper translation yet but you want to pretend that it is actually present.\n\nPlease note that translations with the [VOID] value won't be saved to the translation memory.\n\n[TRUE], [FALSE] – these placeholders will be exported as platform-specific boolean values.\n\nPlease note that [VOID], [TRUE], and [FALSE] placeholders should be the only text in a given translation. For example, This sentence is [FALSE] is incorrect usage of the [FALSE] placeholder and will be simply exported as a plain text."
